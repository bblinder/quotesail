"When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own — not of the same blood or birth, but of the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions." -- Marcus Aurelius

"Being exactly wrong is actually a useful thing to be. It’s the next best thing to being right. You can get to right by flipping exactly wrong. Flipping somewhat wrong merely makes you somewhat wrong in a new way." -- Venkatesh Rao
"Allons Travailler!" -- Émile Zola
"We are no other than a moving row; Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go; Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern held; In Midnight by the Master of the Show; But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays ; Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days; Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays; And one by one back in the Closet lays." -- From The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
“For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.” — H. L. Mencken
